# Intro to MERN and MEAN Stack

**Definition/Overview:** MERN and MEAN stack developers are JavaScript web app developers that unite client and server side web development with CRUD database operations (that is to say, *C*reate, *R*ead, *U*pdate, and *D*elete operations). Thus, these positions are said to be 'full-stack' web development positions.
  
Each letter in the MERN and MEAN acronyms stands for a technology of the profession's integrated stack. Notice that there is only one letter/technology of difference among the four letters of each (the third letter, which is either an 'R' or an 'A'). The acronyms stand for:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - This is a 'NoSQL' database technology, which relies on JSON-like documents called 'BSON' for data storage.
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
  - This is a JavaScript framework to build out and establish server-side ('backend') APIs.
* [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) *or* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
  - ReactJS is a client-side library of JavaScript code, utilized in creating and customizing user interfaces (UIs) via components. It generally takes less time to learn the basics of than AngularJS.
  - AngularJS, likewise, is client-side and used to build out UIs. However, it is a *framework* and relies on additional technological integrations (e.g., TypeScript) that the developer should have knowledge of.  
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - This is a runtime environment for backend/server-side JavaScript code, executing it directly in the terminal/console. Thankfully, it is not necessarily difficult to learn.
  
Notice: 'MERN' or 'MEAN' is spelled out, depending on whether that third technology is ReactJS or AngularJS. 

**So why choose the 'A' over the 'R', or the 'R' over the 'A'?**: In addition to the aforementioned learning curve difference between ReactJS and AngularJS, ReactJS may be better suited for simple web apps, while the latter can be a more efficacious choice for complex enterprise organizational apps that require extensive project maintenance and code consistency. This is not to say that ReactJS is somehow a lesser technology than AngularJS, but *is* to say that it is an excellent choice for quickly building smaller apps from a tried and tested component library that provides an abstract layer for user interfacing.
