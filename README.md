# Intro to MERN and MEAN Stack

**Definition/Overview:** MERN and MEAN stack developers are JavaScript web app developers that unite client and server side web development with CRUD database operations (that is to say, *C*reate, *R*ead, *U*pdate, and *D*elete operations). Thus, these positions are said to be 'full-stack' web development positions.
  
Each letter in the MERN and MEAN acronyms stands for a technology of the profession's integrated stack. Notice that there is only one letter/technology of difference among the four letters of each (the third letter, which is either an 'R' or an 'A'). The acronyms stand for:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - A 'NoSQL' database technology, relying on JSON-like documentation (BSON) for data storage.
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
  - A JavaScript framework for building out and establishing server-side ('backend') APIs.
* [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) *or* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
  - ReactJS is a client-side library of JS code for creating and customizing user interfaces (UIs) via components. Generally takes less time to learn the basics of than AngularJS.
  - AngularJS is also a client-side UI building technology. However, it is a *framework* and relies on additional technological integrations (e.g., TypeScript).  
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - A runtime environment for executing backend JavaScript code directly in terminal/console, with a gentle learning curve.
  
*MERN* or *MEAN* is spelled out, depending on whether the third technology in the stack is ReactJS or AngularJS. 

**Why choose 'A' over 'R', or 'R' over 'A'?**: In addition to the aforementioned learning curve difference, ReactJS may be better suited for simple web apps while AngularJS can be a more efficacious choice for enterprise web apps that require extensive project maintenance and code consistency. ReactJS is not an intrinsically 'lesser' technology than AngularJS, but can be the superior option for quickly building smaller apps from a tried-and-tested component library with an abstract layer for user interfacing.
