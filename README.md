# Intro to MERN and MEAN Stack

**Definition/Overview:** MERN and MEAN stack developers are JavaScript web app developers that unite client and server side web development with CRUD database operations (that is to say, *C*reate, *R*ead, *U*pdate, and *D*elete operations). Thus, these positions are said to be 'full-stack' web development positions.
  
Each letter in the MERN and MEAN acronyms stands for a technology of the profession's integrated stack. Notice that there is only one letter/technology of difference among the four letters of each (the third letter, which is either an 'R' or an 'A'). The acronyms stand for:

* MongoDB
  - This is a 'NoSQL' database technology, which relies on JSON-like documents called 'BSON' for data storage.
* ExpressJS
  - This is a JavaScript framework to build out and establish server-side ('backend') APIs.
* ReactJS *or* AngularJS
  - ReactJS is a client-side library of JavaScript code, utilized in creating and customizing user interfaces (UIs) via components. It generally takes less time to learn the basics of than AngularJS.
  - AngularJS, likewise, is client-side and used to build out UIs. However, it is a *framework* and relies on additional technological integrations (e.g., TypeScript) that the developer should have knowledge of.  
* NodeJS
  - This is a runtime environment for backend/server-side JavaScript code, executing it directly in the terminal/console. Thankfully, it is not necessarily difficult to learn.
  
Notice: 'MERN' or 'MEAN' is spelled out, depending on whether that third technology is ReactJS or AngularJS.
